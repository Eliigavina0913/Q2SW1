At seven years old, she is the fourth youngest of the Loud siblings, as well as Lola's (older by two minutes) twin sister. Both attend second grade, but that's where their similarities end. In contrast to Lola's girly personality, Lana is a tomboy. She enjoys the outdoors, namely playing in the mud and finding frogs. She is an expert junior plumber, and no job is too gross or tough to handle.
